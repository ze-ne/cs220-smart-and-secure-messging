/* For TAs: all accesses (except for the constructor) in Kotlin must go through the getter and setter.
 * This is because variables are properties and all properties have a private field.
 * Therefore we achieve encapsulation Kotlin by defining custom getters and setters.
 * This style is standard Kotlin convention called "Backing Fields".
 * That is why in some cases we don't need to declare variables with private modifiers.
 * In the cases that we do need private modifiers, it is when we need "Backing Properties".
 * Please go here for more information: https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/properties.html
